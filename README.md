# Docker image builds
Dockerfiles and structures for image builds
You can pull these images from my Docker Hub: 
[https://hub.docker.com/u/simonthomas/](https://hub.docker.com/u/simonthomas/ "simonthomas's Profile - Docker Hub")

All the information about the builds are in the README.md of each image folder.
